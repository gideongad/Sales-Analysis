 ### Data Cleaning/Preparation

 1. Data loading and inspection
 2. Handling measure values
 3. Data cleaning and formatting
    
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key such as;

- What is the overall financial trend?
- What branch has the most deposit?
- what is the peak financial period? 

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql 
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Finding

The analysis result are summarized as follows;
1. The company sales  have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a notable peak during the month of March.
2. Product category A is the best performing category in term of sales and revenue.
3. Customers segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendation

Base on the analysis, we recommend the following actions;
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on explaining and promoting products in Category A.
- implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high LTV customers effectively.
  
 ### Limitation

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of the conclusion from the analysis. there are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a position correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
